# Hi there, my name is Alexandra Marie Tribe (Sasha for short)ðŸ‘‹

## Technologies I have worked with

### Python
#### Machine Learning

Imported sklearn libraries to implement kmeans clustering and used matplotlib to visualise the result of applying the method onto iris dataset.

*May need to change to light mode to view the axis labels*

- Each red dot presents a cluster centre and each colour presents a cluster

Gaussian Mixture Clustering:

This is the result when we changed the number of clusters to be 5:

PCA and Linear Discriminant Analysis


### HTML, CSS, JS:
#### A basic To-do list:
![To-do list screenshot](to-do-list.png)

Allows you to:
 - Add an item then display on to do list
 - Delete an item in the to-do list
 - Check the item in the to-do list

#### A Basic Timer:
![Timer Website screenshot](timer.png)
**Starts timer from 10 minutes down.**

Allows you to:
    - You can pause the timer
    - You can resume the time
